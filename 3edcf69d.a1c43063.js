We will capture digital phenotypes of participants as well as signals related to interventions like mood, anxiety, diet, sleep, steps etc (as noted above). We will compare a standard intervention (using the app to deliver generic advice and instructions about pre-defined interventions) with a personalised one (using information based on individual differences and preferences in a personalised and dynamic way). All data will be de-identified and made freely available to the scientific community at the end of the study.")))}b.isMDXComponent=!0},355:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return p})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return h}));var n=a(0),i=a.n(n);function o(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function r(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,n)}return a}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?r(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){o(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):r(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,i={},o=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<o.length;n++)a=o[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(i[a]=e[a]);return i}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(n=0;n<o.length;n++)a=o[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(i[a]=e[a])}return i}var c=i.a.createContext({}),b=function(e){var t=i.a.useContext(c),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),a},p=function(e){var t=b(e.components);return i.a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},d={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,{},t)}},u=i.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var a=e.components,n=e.mdxType,o=e.originalType,r=e.parentName,c=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),p=b(a),u=n,h=p["".concat(r,".").concat(u)]||p[u]||d[u]||o;return a?i.a.createElement(h,s(s({ref:t},c),{},{components:a})):i.a.createElement(h,s({ref:t},c))}));function h(e,t){var a=arguments,n=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||n){var o=a.length,r=new Array(o);r[0]=u;var s={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(s[l]=t[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:n,r[1]=s;for(var c=2;c<o;c++)r[c]=a[c];return i.a.createElement.apply(null,r)}return i.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}u.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
