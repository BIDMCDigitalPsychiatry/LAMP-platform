As a Participant actively enrolled in a study uses the app, including interacting with Activities available therein, sensor instruments periodically collect measurements in the background. These data are submitted to the Cloud server which notifies and activates the correct set of Automations in the right order. These could include Visualizations, Predictive Models, or Clinical Decision Support systems that were installed by the Researcher supervising that Participant\u2019s study.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"develop/intro":{"id":"develop/intro","title":"Components of the LAMP Platform","description":"The LAMP Platform API Server manages all internal components and inter-component message-passing.
