Further, they do not capture intraindividual variation in cognition across time (day-to-day, hour-to-hour) and context (e.g., mood, environment).\xa0Repeated assessment using smartphones represents a potential solution to these limitations, but validation is needed across populations and cognitive domains. In this study we assess the convergent validity of smartphone-based tests by examining relations with standard neuropsychological assessments and self-reported executive dysfunction in young adults (YAs) and individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).\n\n**Participants and Methods:** 179 YAs (undergraduate students) and 20 persons with PD completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, including the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A). Over the following 10 days they were prompted 5x/day to complete smartphone-based assessments of working memory (Backwards Spatial Span) and complex attention (Trails-B). PD participants completed lab-based equivalents of these tests, WMS-III Spatial Span and Trails A & B, along with the MoCA, at baseline. We examined associations between lab- and smartphone-based measures using multilevel modeling to account for clustering of observations within people. Lab-based measures were entered as fixed effect predictors of variance in smartphone-based assessments.\n\n**Results:** BRIEF ratings in both YA and PD samples did not predict smartphone-based assessments nor lab-based measures in PD. In the PD sample, Trails-B at baseline predicted significant variance in smartphone-based Trails-B scores (*p*=0.03); Backwards Spatial Span score at baseline showed a trend association with Backwards Spatial Span as measured by smartphone (*p*=0.11). MoCA score at baseline also showed a trend association with smartphone-based Trails-B (*p*=0.05) and Backwards Spatial Span (*p*=0.08) scores.\n\n**Conclusions** We provide preliminary evidence of convergent validity between smartphone-based assessments of complex attention and working memory and traditional neuropsychological tests in people with PD. Self-report of executive dysfunction did not relate to objective lab- or smartphone-based measures. These findings pave the way for a new era of more personalized assessment of cognition in real-world settings, with potential for more precise diagnosis and treatment.\n")),Object(o.b)("ul",null,Object(o.b)("li",{parentName:"ul"},Object(o.b)("p",{parentName:"li"},Object(o.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Abstract:")," Mobile cognitive assessment via smartphones: Studying how context shapes cognition in young adults and persons with Parkinson\u2019s disease"),Object(o.b)("p",{parentName:"li"}," ",Object(o.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Authors")," Emma Weizenbaum, Alice Cronin-Golomb, Emma L.
