Sensors are passive data markers that allow the mindLAMp team to create features out of raw passive data. An example of this is using accelerometer, which is detected by the motion of your phone, to create a measure of sleep duration based on when your phone is not moving for an extended period of time at parts of the day. Sensor data collection allows for data analysis to glean insights about how sensor data may be related to active data. If someone was wondering if a patient is experiencing greater depressive symptoms and if that is related to them being at home for longer, a researcher could view the time they may be spending at home based on the GPS data and then look at how their mood scores may reflect changes based on the GPS data. Sensors are added by researchers through the Dashboard and data is obtained through users accepting permissions for the app to access their device's native sensor features (like allowing for mindLAMP to access your location when you open the app for the first time on an iOS device)."]})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:s}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return s?(0,n.jsx)(s,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},86385:(e,s,t)=>{t.d(s,{A:()=>a});const a=t.p+"assets/images/voicerecordingdocs3.3.2022-c4defaf7f35bd6d468150131cc017f61.png"},99105:(e,s,t)=>{t.d(s,{A:()=>a});const a=t.p+"assets/images/assess2-dcfbb62bfa48da395277785dbca9992d.png"}}]);
