These graphs will be attached to the Data Portal. \\n* The secondary feature `step_count` unifies iOS and Android steps.\\n* Sleep information is gathered through Healthkit from watches. This data is aggregated in the secondary feature `healthkit_sleep_duration`. Duration of \\"in_bed\\", \\"in_sleep\\", or \\"in_awake\\" time can be computed.\\n* Survey scoring has been refactored to allow for grouping of questions and more advanced scoring. A scoring dictionary is passed to map questions to categories. Users can also provide mappings from responses to integers for scoring.\\n* `inactive_duration` is an early iteration of our newest sleep algorithm. It searches for the longest bouts without any spikes in accelerometer or screen activity. Inactive duration will continue to be revised in future releases.\\n\\nFor further information, please visit our documentation [here](https://docs.lamp.digital/data_science/Cortex/cortex)."},{"id":"/2022/03/07/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/03/07/","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-07.md","title":"","description":"Features & Improvements","date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 7, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":0.17,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ashley Meyer","title":"Division of Digital Psychiatry","url":"https://github.com/akmeyer3","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96262286?v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"","permalink":"/blog/2022/03/22/"},"nextItem":{"title":"","permalink":"/blog/2022/2/15/"}},"content":"### Features & Improvements\\n- iOS and Android app updates are now available that primarily resolve notification timezone issues.

You\'ll find the **Learn**, **Assess**, **Manage**, and **Prevent** tabs familiar, but now simplified and better organized.\\n- Management of studies and clinics is now simplified with a visual makeover that you can use in the browser dashboard or on-the-go when logged in as a clinician in the mobile app.\\n\\n### New activities and interventions\\n\\n- We\'ve ported over some classics such as **Surveys** or the beloved **Jewels** game from mindLAMP 1, so you won\'t miss those.\\n- We\'ve also added brand new activities such as **Tips** for customizable articles, **Breathe** for meditation and breathing exercises, **Journal** for a digital journal and thoughts tracker, and several more!\\n- **Conversations** now allow you to communicate with study participants or patients in the clinic. *(This is a completely optional feature that is disabled by default.
