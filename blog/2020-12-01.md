# Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue in the Breathe activity where the duration of the exercise did not correctly match the length of the audio, if one was uploaded or specified.
- Resolved an issue where adding a vector image (SVG) as a custom activity icon caused the icon to be erroneously compressed and pixelated.
- Resolved an issue with the Activity and Participant tabs of the management console displaying information slowly and in the wrong or random order.
