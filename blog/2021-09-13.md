# Scheduled Routine mindLAMP AWS Maintenance

Hi all,

mindLAMP will go down for a few hours *early EST* on **Friday, October 10, 2021** for scheduled AWS maintenance. This will make the LAMP app and dashboard unavailable for the time being for most users, researchers, clinicians, and users alike. If the platform is not back up late Friday, please let us know and feel free to reach out.
