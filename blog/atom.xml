<ul>
<li>Data quality visualizations include activity counts, passive data quality, and features (home time, screen duration, and step counts). These graphs will be attached to the Data Portal.</li>
<li>The secondary feature <code>step_count</code> unifies iOS and Android steps.</li>
<li>Sleep information is gathered through Healthkit from watches. This data is aggregated in the secondary feature <code>healthkit_sleep_duration</code>. Duration of "in_bed", "in_sleep", or "in_awake" time can be computed.</li>
<li>Survey scoring has been refactored to allow for grouping of questions and more advanced scoring. A scoring dictionary is passed to map questions to categories. Users can also provide mappings from responses to integers for scoring.</li>
<li><code>inactive_duration</code> is an early iteration of our newest sleep algorithm. It searches for the longest bouts without any spikes in accelerometer or screen activity. Inactive duration will continue to be revised in future releases.</li>

<p>mindLAMP will go down for a few hours <em>early EST</em> on <strong>Friday, October 1, 2021</strong> for scheduled AWS maintenance. This will make the LAMP app and dashboard unavailable for the time being for most users, researchers, clinicians, and users alike. If the platform is not back up late Friday, please let us know and feel free to reach out.</p>]]></content>
