him.”</li></ul><p>For many situations, you don’t know what happened but before you “jump to conclusions,” slow down and think about other things that could be going on.

When you are relaxed, the opposite happens. By slowing down the breath, you trick your brain into thinking you are relaxed, and all the relaxation neurochemicals are released.</p><p>Belly Breathing is a technique you can use to relax and become more aware of your breathing. Belly Breathing can help you to calm and center yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="steps-2">Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#steps-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ol><li>Sit comfortably and straighten your back.</li><li>Place your hands on your belly and slow your breathing down.</li><li>Inhale fully and gently breathing through your nose.</li><li>Keep your breaths smooth and steady while feeling your belly and chest expanding.</li><li>Exhale fully and slowly blowing all the air back out of your lungs.</li><li>Let your belly sink down flat.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="practice-2">Practice<a class="hash-link" href="#practice-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the beginning, try to practice Belly Breathing for five minutes at least once a day.</p><p>Letting your breath fill your body will give you the calmness you need to face social situations, a job interview, or even the world.

D</a></em></p><p><em>Category: EBP – CBT - Skills Training / Relapse Reduction | © Vinfen 2020</em></p><header><h1>Compassion</h1></header><p>Compassion is the ability to feel the emotions of another person. When you are compassionate, you can take the perspective of another and you have the desire to help. Being compassionate makes you feel good and can help you to handle stress. Using strategies to be compassionate can improve your health, well-being, and personal relationships.</p><p>Compassion starts with appreciation,
<a href="http://www.powerofpositivity.com/11-habits-of-happy-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gratitude</a>, and self-love. Some compassion strategies you can practice include:</p><ul><li>Give back or volunteer for a greater purpose</li><li>Model kindness to others. Practice at least one small act of kindness every day to make someone’s life better (i.e. write a positive note, give a compliment, offer to help, say kind words, hold the door)</li><li>When you wake up or go to bed, write down at least one thing that you are grateful for, that you <a href="https://www.powerofpositivity.com/10-tips-on-how-to-appreciate-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appreciate about your life</a>, and what you’ve been given.</li><li>Think about someone you care about (i.e. a partner, friend, parent, or even a beloved animal). Focus on them and direct your attention towards them with three basic feelings and thoughts: may you be well, may you be happy, and may you be free of suffering.</li><li>Choose a compassionate phrase such as “Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible” (Dalai Lama). Practice saying your compassionate phrase as many times as possible each day.</li><li>Think of a time when someone was kind to you. Recall how it felt to receive that kindness including the things this person said, the feeling of the emotion in the person, and the experience.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="steps-4">Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#steps-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ol><li>Choose one Compassion Strategy.</li><li>Practice your Compassion Strategy every day.</li><li>Try different Compassion Strategies to see which one works for you.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="practice-4">Practice<a class="hash-link" href="#practice-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Practice Compassion Strategies every day. This will help you make Compassion Strategies a part of your everyday routine. If a daily practice is made of showing kindness, it will eventually become something that is done without much thought and effort.</p><p><em>Category: EBP – CBT - Skills Training / Relapse Reduction | © Vinfen 2020</em></p><header><h1>Coping Strategies</h1></header><p>Life is persistent in teaching you lessons. Life is like school for the soul; it will keep presenting you with the same stressful problems until you finally learn what you need to learn. When problems show up repeatedly, don’t take it personally, just know that there is more for you to learn. Developing Coping Strategies can help you to manage problems and cope with stress. Examples of strategies for coping and stress relief include:</p><ul><li><strong>Get enough sleep.</strong> If possible, try to go to bed and get up at the same time. Remember that alcohol and caffeine add to sleep problems.</li><li><strong>Reduce your caffeine and sugar.</strong> Eat meals or snacks throughout the day. Hunger and low blood sugar can increase stress and negative emotions.</li><li><strong>Increase your fun.</strong> Every day do something you really enjoy. Try to see the humor in situations and people. Laughter is a great stress reliever.</li><li><strong>Take a short media fast.</strong> Turn off the phone, the TV, and the computer occasionally.</li><li><strong>Breathe.</strong> When stressed, most people take short, shallow breaths. This reinforces anxiety. Do the opposite and take some long, deep breaths whenever you remember to during the day.</li><li><strong>Spend some time out in nature.</strong> Relax by taking a walk outside or sitting in the sun.

When you are on Auto-Pilot you are preoccupied and just “going through the motions.” You are acting on habit and without intention.</p><p>Some examples of being on Auto- Pilot include stressing, worrying about what will happen, daydreaming, or being lost in your own world. In a car, we can sometimes drive for miles “on Auto-Pilot,” without really being aware of what we are doing. In the same way, we may not be really “present” moment-by-moment, for much of our lives: We can often be “miles away” without knowing it.</p><p>When you are on Auto-Pilot emotionally, it is easy to “slip” into moods, become lost in your emotions, and wrapped up in your thoughts. You are more likely to have your “buttons pressed” and unhelpful thinking may lead to worsening mood. When you no longer know what you are feeling or why, it is easy to become disconnected.</p><p>When you become mindful of your actions and get off Auto-Pilot you become empowered to make positive change.

Completely eliminating voices altogether might not be possible but lowering the volume so you can focus on your day is achievable!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="steps-18">Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#steps-18" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When practicing 3-Step Control, use your senses and movement to pay full attention to the task. Your mind’s thinking and your body should become fully engaged. This reduces distractions such as voices and improves control of your thinking.</p><ul><li>Rate how much your voices distract you on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high)</li><li>For 2 to 10 minutes or until you run out of objects, use your body and mind to attend to one object at a time.<ol><li>Look at an object</li><li>Point to the object</li><li>Name the object out loud</li></ol></li><li>Rate your voices on the 1-5 scale again. Do you notice any positive change?</li></ul><p><strong>Practice</strong></p><p>Understanding when and how you experience voices can help you to gain knowledge about how best to manage them. Practice 3-Step Control at least once a day, when you are <strong>not</strong> experiencing hearing voices or during a time that voices are <strong>not</strong> problematic. The goal is to get into the habit of using the skill so you can become more comfortable with it. The more you practice, the more 3-Step Control becomes second nature and you can use it anytime, with ease.</p><p><em>Category: EBP – CBT - Skills Training / Relapse Reduction | © Vinfen
