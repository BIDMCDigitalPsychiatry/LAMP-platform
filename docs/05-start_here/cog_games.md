# Cognitive Games and Assessments

mindLAMP offers a variety of neurocognitive assessments in the form of games, which are native to the app. These will show up on the **Assess** page of the app, and performance scores can be displayed on the **Prevent** page.

## Jewels

Jewels replicates the Trail Making Tests, in which participants are asked to sequentially select numbered jewels in the correct ascending order. In Jewels A, participants must select jewels starting from 1 in ascending order, within a given time limit. The amount of jewels correctly selected as well as the number of mistakes are both assessed. In Jewels B, participants must select alternately between two types of jewels in ascending order. Participants are indicated which jewel shape they must begin at number 1 with. 

**Sample Instructions, Jewels A:** "*Tap the jewels in chronological order, starting with number 1."*

**Sample Instructions, Jewels B:** "*Look at the bottom of the screen to see which jewel to collect first. Tap number of 1 of that shape, and then number 1 of the second shape. Continue alternating the jewel pattern in chronological order until all of the jewels have been collected."*

## Box Game

The Box Game is a spatial span task, in which participants must recall and reproduce the order in which boxes in a grid light up. The task can be customized such that the patterns must be reproduced in the same order as shown, or in reverse of the order shown on.  

**Sample Instructions, Forward Box Game:** "*You will see a grid of boxes. The boxes in a grid will light up in a certain order. Remember that order, and then tap the boxes in the same order in which they lit up. Each level will have more boxes light up in the sequence. See how far you can get!"*

**Sample Instructions, Backwards Box Game:** "*You will see a grid of boxes. The boxes in a grid will light up in a certain order. Remember that order, and then tap the boxes in the REVERSE order in which they lit up. Each level will have more boxes light up in the sequence. See how far you can get!"*


## Balloon Risk

Balloon Risk is a risk-reward task, in which participants must tap to inflate a balloon to the largest possible size without it bursting. The task can be customized to alter the mean number of taps required to burst the balloon, as well as the standard deviation for the number of taps required. Participants are given points based on the number of taps they made before they stopped inflating the balloon, or no points if the balloon burst.

**Sample Instructions:** *Tap the button to 'Pump Up Balloon' to inflate it as large as you can, before the balloon bursts. When you feel like you can't inflate it anymore without it bursting, tap the button to 'Collect Points'. The number of times you pumped up the balloon will be equal to the number of points you get. If the balloon bursts, you get no points!*


## Cats and Dogs

Cats and Dogs is a task that tests visual and working memory, attention, and response control. In this task, participants are first shown a pattern of boxes. The boxes temporarily lift, to reveal the image of a dog or a cat behind some of them. Participants are asked to select the boxes which have one of the two types of animals behind them. The instructions for which animal cues the correct boxes change across the trials.

**Sample Instructions:** *In this game, you will see a screen with many boxes. These boxes will 'lift', revealing either a dog, cat, or nothing behind them. Your task is to tap the correct boxes, based on what is behind each box. The instructions for which boxes are correct will change depending on the level, so pay attention to the animals!*

## Pop the Bubbles

Pop the Bubbles is a type of go/no-go task that can measure sustained attention and response control. In this task, participants are given instruction to 'pop' bubbles of a certain color and pattern, and to ignore bubbles of another color and pattern. The task can be customized by the clinician or researcher to adjust the speed at which each bubble is presented, and the number of bubbles shown for a given level. Final scores on based on the number of bubbles successfully popped and the number of incorrectly popped bubbles.

**Sample Instructions:** *In this game, you will see lots of different colored bubbles, one at a time. Your task is to "pop" the correctly colored bubbles, while ignoring the incorrect ones. Pay attention to the instructions for each level to know which colored bubbles you should tap, and which ones you should ignore.*
