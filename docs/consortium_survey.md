We request that if using mindLAMP to administer surveys, consortium partners agree to use the following questions in a survey sent once to participants. This so there are common elements across all studies using mindLAMP and feedback collected on use. Each question should be asked and rated on a Likert scale.

- I thought LAMP was easy to use.
- I felt very confident using LAMP.
- I enjoy using LAMP.
- How would you rate your experience with LAMP?
- How would you rate LAMP's usability?
