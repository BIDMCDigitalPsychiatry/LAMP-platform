# M - Manage

The manage tab includes a variety of activities for various necessities. Some serve as relaxation exercises, while others involve meditations. Others include journaling and future manage activities will include medication trackers and goal setting. As LAMP develops, more and more manage activities can be expected to be added! As a user, you can also request for the researchers running your study to create individualized manage activities (i.e. having a breathing activity to a specific sound or music clip that you find relaxing).

All activities are available through the Manage tab. See below is an outline of the activities currently available or coming soon as well as relevant images of what they may look like.

**Journal**

*Record thoughts, write lists, and make notes. Journal entries are date and time stamped so previous entries can be recalled and read at any time.*
