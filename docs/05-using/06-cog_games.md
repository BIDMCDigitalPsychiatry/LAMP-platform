# Cognitive Games and Assessments

mindLAMP offers a variety of neurocognitive assessments in the form of games, all of which are native to the app. These neurocognitive assessments appear under the **Assess** tab of the app, and performance scores can be viewed on the **Portal** tab.

## Balloon Risk

Balloon Risk, or the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a computerized risk-reward assessment task (1). The BART has shown to be significantly correlated to self report scores on risk related constructs such as sensation seeking, impulsivity and behavioral constraint, as well as real world risk behaviors such as drug use, gambling, and sexually risky behavior (1, 2, 3). The user must tap to inflate a balloon as many times as possible without popping it. The task has been successfully used as a computerized assessment for risk-taking behavior. Every time the user taps to inflate the balloon, the potential number of points the user can receive increases: if the user clicks on "collect points," these points are added to the user's current total; if, however, the user pops the balloon before clicking on "collect points," no points are added to the user's current total. The number of taps it takes for the balloon to pop is different for each balloon.

</p>

### Scoring
Scoring is based on whether or not the balloon pops: if the balloon does not pop and the user clicks on "collect points", the number of points the user receives is the number of times the user has inflated the balloon without it popping; if the balloon does pop, the user receives 0 points.

### Sample Instructions
*Tap the button labeled 'Pump Up Balloon' to inflate it as large as you can, before the balloon bursts. When you feel like you can't inflate it anymore without it bursting, tap the button to 'Collect Points'. The number of times you pumped up the balloon will be equal to the number of points you get. If the balloon bursts, you get no points!*

## Cats and Dogs

Originally developed for the assessment of early-stage Parkinson's disease, Cats and Dogs is a digital task that tests multiple domains at once: in particular, visual and working memory, attention, response control, and set-shifting (1). The user must remember the location of multiple stimuli, remember which stimuli to respond to and which to ignore, reproduce the location of the response stimuli from memory, and switch between which stimuli to pay attention to. In this task, the user is presented with an array of boxes. The boxes temporarily disappear, revealing a dog or a cat behind some of them. After the boxes reappear, the user must select the boxes with a cat or dog behind them. As the game progresses, the instructions change to assess response control and set-shifting, and the user must select either cats or dogs, which collectively function as go/no-go stimuli. For later trials with a fixed level, the user will be required to remember more cues.

### Customization

The game automatically progresses as levels are completed. No researcher-defined customization is necessary.

### Scoring 
Scoring is based on the number of correct cats or dogs selected within the timeframe of the game.

### Sample Instructions

*"In this game, you will see a screen with many boxes. These boxes will 'lift', revealing either a dog, cat, or nothing behind them. Your task is to tap the correct boxes, based on what is behind each box. The instructions for which boxes are correct will change depending on the level, so pay attention to the animals!"*


## DCog (coming soon!)
Similar to the Cats and Dogs game, the Dcog game presents the user with an array of boxes and, after briefly revealing what is hidden between them, asks the user to click on the boxes behind which dogs are hidden; the game itself is similar to its iBOCA3 counterpart. If the user correctly selects all of the boxes with dogs behind them, the next level has 2 additional boxes and 1 more dog; if, on the other hand, the user does not correctly select all of the boxes with dogs behind them, the next level has 2 fewer boxes and 1 less dog. The number of boxes on the screen caps at 10, and the game lasts no longer than 2 minutes.

## Digit Symbol Substitution Test

The symbol-digit substitution task has been used to evaluate motor speed, attention, associative thinking (1). Initially developed as part of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and later digitized, the task is one of the most frequently used assessment in neuropsychological testing (1, 2, 3). The measure has shown to be valid and sensitive to change in major depressive disorder, age-related cognitive decline, alcoholism and a variety of other conditions (3). Given a mapping of various symbols to numbers 1-9, the user is presented with a symbol and required to tap the corresponding number.

### Scoring
Scoring is based on the total number of correct symbols selected within the given timeframe.

### Sample Instructions

*In this game, you will be shown a symbol in the center of the screen. This symbol will correspond to a number. Check the symbol-mapping shown at the top of the screen and look for your symbol. Identify the symbol which corresponds to your symbol. Once you find the corresponding symbol, select the corresponding number at the bottom of the screen. After you make the correct selection, you will move on to a new symbol, and the process will repeat until time runs out. The faster you move, the more points you will accrue.*

## Emotion Recognition
The emotion recognition task is designed to allow researchers to upload up to 50 pictures of faces and test whether the user can select the emotion that each image represents from a preset list of emotions (namely, happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and neutral). When a user takes this assessment, they are presented with a random subset of 10 images from the images provided by the researchers. If the researchers provided fewer than 10 images, all images will be displayed in a random order. To progress through this assessment, participants first click on the emotion they feel best applies to the image and then on "Save" to move onto the next question.

### Sample game play
The user progresses through a series of up to 10 screens in which they are presented with an image and must select the corresponding emotion from a list of options.
Video to be added soon.

### Scoring
Scoring is based on whether the user correctly identifies the emotion expressed by the image or not.

### Sample Instructions

*In this task you will be presented with up to 10 facial images and asked to identify the emotion expressed by each one from a list of 5 emotions.*


## Fragmented Letters (coming soon!)
In the Fragmented Letters game, the user is presented with letters of the alphabet written in black ink on a white background that have been slightly "fragmented", in that some parts of the letters blend in with the background. Fragmentation is understood as the number of pixels in the letter that are white instead of black, out of the total number of pixels normally in the letter. The user must attempt to verbally identify the fragmented letter: if the user correctly identifies the letter, the next letter in the sequence is even more fragmented by 5%; if the user, however, does not correctly identify the letter, the next letter in the sequence is less fragmented by 5%. The game concludes after the user has made two errors.

## Funny Memory Game (coming soon!)
The Funny Memory Game, similarly to the iBOCA3 Associative Memory Game, tests the user's associative memory by presenting a series of images in pairs and asking the user (1) to verbally identify the items in the images during the initial exposure phase; (2) to verbally recall the images during the recall phase, following a delay of between 1 to 5 minutes, during which the user completes some memory surveys; and (3) to verbally recognize either what is missing from a given image or which image had been presented before.

## Jewels

A test in which the user must sequentially select numbered jewels in ascending order, Jewels is based on the Trail Making Tests which are typically used to screen for dementia and assess cognition, evaluating visual and motor abilities, executive functioning, and set shifting (1): Trails A requires the user to make a "trail" connecting numbered circles placed randomly on a single page in ascending order; Trails B requires the user to make a similar trail, alternating between numbered and alphabetized circles. Evidence suggests that digital and computerized version of the pen-and-paper Trail Making Test reliably assess the same cognitive domains. (2, 3, 4). For Jewels B, instead of having alternating numbers and alphabets, the sets alternate between two differently shaped jewels.

</p>

### Scoring

Scoring for both variants is based on the number of incorrect jewels selected: scoring is out of 100 points, with each incorrect jewel resulting in a deduction of 2 points.

### Sample Instructions

**Sample Instructions, Jewels A:** *"Tap the jewels in chronological order, starting with number 1."*

**Sample Instructions, Jewels B:** *"Look at the bottom of the screen to see which jewel to collect first. Tap number of 1 of that shape, and then number 1 of the second shape. Continue alternating the jewel pattern in chronological order until all of the jewels have been collected."*


## Maze Task

The Maze task can be used to measure motor control, and spatial problem solving. Though there is not a gold standard model, digital maze games have been utilized in the assessment of visual cognition and problem solving in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders, brain injury, and schizophrenia (1, 2, 3). Participants can tilt their phone to move the ball and exit the maze. The first level starts with one ball and two rings, and the difficulty increases with each level (more balls, more intricate puzzle designs).

## Pop the Bubbles


An instance of a go/no-go task in which the user must respond to one stimulus and ignore another, Pop the Bubbles presents multiple stimuli in the form of bubbles of 3 different colors (i.e. pink, blue, and yellow), which the user must either "pop" by clicking on them or ignore. The user must pay attention to the rules for each level in order to know which bubbles to pop and which to ignore. In addition to color-based responses, higher levels also require pattern-based responses.

*"In this game, you will see lots of different colored bubbles, one at a time. Your task is to "pop" the correctly colored bubbles, while ignoring the incorrect ones. Pay attention to the instructions for each level to know which colored bubbles you should tap, and which ones you should ignore. Your score is based on the percentage of balloons shown that you correctly tapped, minus the percentage of balloons shown that you incorrectly tapped, with a perfect score being 100%."*

## Spatial Span

Spatial Span is a task that assess visuospatial memory, derived from a computerized spatial span test, and iterating upon the commonly used Corsi Block Test and Wechsler Spatial Span tests (1). Spatial span assessments have been used in a variety of populations, including idividuals with autism, psychosis, and depression (2, 3, 4). In this game, white squares are arranged in a grid. Squares will "light up" or change to green, and then return to white, one square at a time. The user must recall and reproduce the order in which squares in the grid light up. The task can be customized such that the patterns must be reproduced in the same order as cued, or in reverse of the order cued. At every subsequent level, the number of squares that light up increases. The recall and reproduce task utilizes the visuospatial working memory. The backward variation also measures working memory, as some processing must be done before reproducing the pattern. Finally, memory capacity is assessed by increasing the number of squares to the user must remember.

## Spin the Wheel

Spin the Wheel is based on the Iowa Gambling Task that aims to measure decision-making and risk-taking behavior (1). The Iowa Gambling Task has been effectively used in studying clinical conditions such as substance abuse, pathological gambling, and schizophrenia (2). The task has been effectively computerized, with no discernable difference between digital and analogue versions (2, 3). The game presents the user with a wheel that can be spun by selecting one of four buttons at the bottom of the screen. Each spin can result in a win or loss of money, and the total amount remaining is displayed at the top of the screen. Participants start with $2000 and have 20 spins per game by default.
