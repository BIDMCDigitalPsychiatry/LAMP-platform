# Affirmations

Affirmations are positive words that you say to yourself to achieve success. Affirmations are used to remind yourself of your strengths and your worth. Affirmations are something that you want to be true. They are spoken as statements of fact which help you to believe in them. Affirmations can help when you are feeling down about yourself, nervous, or even when you are excited about the day ahead.

### Steps

1. Choose at least one affirmation such as:
	- I accept myself for who I am.
	- I have a lot to be proud of.
	- I have the power to make my dreams come true.
	- I am resilient.
	- I have people who love, support, and respect me.
	- I am a loving and caring person.
	- I control my own happiness.
	- I believe in myself.
	- I make a difference.
2. Practice saying your affirmation at least once a day or more by slowly repeating the affirmation numerous times. Let it sink into your mind and body.
3. Hang your affirmation in your room, store an image of it on your phone, or keep a copy in your wallet.

### Practice

Practice Affirmations once a day or more at times when you are feeling well and not distressed. This will help you learn the skill better so you will be able to use Affirmations in harder situations when you really need it. The more you practice, the more Affirmations become second nature and you can use them anytime, with ease.

# Alternative Explanations

Alternative Explanations (Alt-Ex) is a skill that can help you to think about situations in a different way. This will help you control your feelings and reactions to that situation. Alternative Explanations can help you to feel less stressed and anxious. Alt-Ex can also help you to clear your head a bit so you can think straight.

Here is an example:

You leave a message for your brother and he doesn’t return your call.
- Do you jump to conclusions and **think** “he’s ignoring me?”
- Do you **feel** upset and angry?
- Do you **act** on these thoughts and feelings? “I’m going to ignore
him.”

For many situations, you don’t know what happened but before you “jump to conclusions,” slow down and think about other things that could be going on. Be creative!

Here is the example again:

You leave a message for your brother and he doesn’t return your call.

Possible explanations could be:
- My brother lost his phone and never received my message.
- My brother is at the dentist and can’t talk right now.

### Steps

Think of a situation in your life that causes you to “jump to conclusions.”

Identify one or more possible explanations to the situation. Be creative.

### Practice

Practice Alt-Ex once a day or more at times when you are feeling well and not stressed. This will help you learn the skill better so you will be able to use Alt-Ex in harder situations when you really need it. The more you practice, the more Alt-Ex becomes second nature and you can use it anytime, with ease.

# Belly Breathing

Often when you are anxious, the result in your body is that your breathing rate increases, and you take shorter, shallower breaths. When you are relaxed, the opposite happens. By slowing down the breath, you trick your brain into thinking you are relaxed, and all the relaxation neurochemicals are released.

Belly Breathing is a technique you can use to relax and become more aware of your breathing. Belly Breathing can help you to calm and center yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed.

### Steps

1. Sit comfortably and straighten your back.
2. Place your hands on your belly and slow your breathing down.
3. Inhale fully and gently breathing through your nose.
4. Keep your breaths smooth and steady while feeling your belly and chest expanding.
5. Exhale fully and slowly blowing all the air back out of your lungs.
6. Let your belly sink down flat.

### Practice

In the beginning, try to practice Belly Breathing for five minutes at least once a day.

Letting your breath fill your body will give you the calmness you need to face social situations, a job interview, or even the world. It’s hard at first but take your time and try again.

# Coping Strategies 

Life is persistent in teaching you lessons. Life is like school for the soul; it will keep presenting you with the same stressful problems until you finally learn what you need to learn. When problems show up repeatedly, don’t take it personally, just know that there is more for you to learn. Developing Coping Strategies can help you to manage problems and cope with stress. Examples of strategies for coping and stress relief include:

- **Get enough sleep.** If possible, try to go to bed and get up at the same time. Remember that alcohol and caffeine add to sleep problems.
- **Reduce your caffeine and sugar.** Eat meals or snacks throughout the day. Hunger and low blood sugar can increase stress and negative emotions.
- **Increase your fun.** Every day do something you really enjoy. Try to see the humor in situations and people. Laughter is a great stress reliever.
- **Take a short media fast.** Turn off the phone, the TV, and the computer occasionally.
- **Breathe.** When stressed, most people take short, shallow breaths. This reinforces anxiety. Do the opposite and take some long, deep breaths whenever you remember to during the day.
- **Spend some time out in nature.** Relax by taking a walk outside or sitting in the sun. Sit next to a tree or pond and look at the sky or the water.
- **Get moving**. Research has proven that exercise is a better anti-depressant than medications for mild to moderate depression.
- **Write your thoughts and feelings down.** Writing can help you clarify things and can give you a renewed perspective.
- **Turn to spirituality for comfort.** Attend a service, pray, talk to God, or ask for help or grace. Consider taking time to meditate, relax, or practice mindfulness.

### Steps

1. Choose one Coping Strategy at a time.
2. Practice your Coping Strategy at least once a day or as often as possible.
3. Try different Coping Strategies to see which one works best.

# Mindfulness Autopilot 

Autopilot is a type of mind state when your attention is only partially aware of the present moment and what is around you. When you are on Auto-Pilot you are preoccupied and just “going through the motions.” You are acting on habit and without intention.

Some examples of being on Auto- Pilot include stressing, worrying about what will happen, daydreaming, or being lost in your own world. In a car, we can sometimes drive for miles “on Auto-Pilot,” without really being aware of what we are doing. In the same way, we may not be really “present” moment-by-moment, for much of our lives: We can often be “miles away” without knowing it.

When you are on Auto-Pilot emotionally, it is easy to “slip” into moods, become lost in your emotions, and wrapped up in your thoughts. You are more likely to have your “buttons pressed” and unhelpful thinking may lead to worsening mood. When you no longer know what you are feeling or why, it is easy to become disconnected.

When you become mindful of your actions and get off Auto-Pilot you become empowered to make positive change. You respond to situations with choice in new and beneficial ways.

### Steps

1. **Choose one activity each day that you often do in Auto-Pilot.**
	Examples include; brushing your teeth, eating a meal, showering, preparing for bed, or walking in the park. Stick with one activity for a week or longer rather than changing the activity regularly.
2. **When the time comes for that activity, do it in a fully present frame of mind**.
	Pay attention to the activity itself and what is happening in the present moment. This includes what is occurring around you (touch, sight, sound, taste, smell) and what is occurring within you (physical and emotional sensations).
	- If you start to think of other things, then note it for a second and return to the sensations of the activity.
	- If the activity is likely to be longer than a few minutes, then practice the first two minutes mindfully.

### Practice

You can get off auto-pilot by practicing over and over again every day to change the focus of your attention; be present and aware; and be open and accepting. The more you practice getting off auto-pilot, the easier it will be to act with intention all the time.

4. What **smells** are in the air?
	> Inhale slowly. Exhale. On the next inhale, what do you smell? What do you smell immediately? What scents do you perceive in the distance? Do this for about 10 breaths.
5. What can you **taste**?
	> Begin to focus on your mouth and the sensations you taste in your mouth. Do you taste the remnants of a recent beverage or meal? Was it sweet or salty?

Breathe in and out two more times being aware of all the wonderful things around you. When you are ready, take a final deep breath and get back to your day with renewed energy and a relaxed state of mind.

Negative thinking can become a habit that is hard to break. It may take weeks or months of practicing the Thought Stopping technique for it to work. Don’t give up! You can be successful.

# 3-Step Control 

3-Step Control is skill to use if you experience auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) that cause anxiety, distress, or distraction. 3-Step Control helps you to focus your attention, feel better, and improve how you interact in the world. Completely eliminating voices altogether might not be possible but lowering the volume so you can focus on your day is achievable!

### Steps

When practicing 3-Step Control, use your senses and movement to pay full attention to the task. Your mind’s thinking and your body should become fully engaged. This reduces distractions such as voices and improves control of your thinking.

- Rate how much your voices distract you on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high)
- For 2 to 10 minutes or until you run out of objects, use your body and mind to attend to one object at a time.
	1. Look at an object
	2. Point to the object
	3. Name the object out loud
- Rate your voices on the 1-5 scale again. Do you notice any positive change?

**Practice**

Understanding when and how you experience voices can help you to gain knowledge about how best to manage them. Practice 3-Step Control at least once a day, when you are **not** experiencing hearing voices or during a time that voices are **not** problematic. The goal is to get into the habit of using the skill so you can become more comfortable with it. The more you practice, the more 3-Step Control becomes second nature and you can use it anytime, with ease.
