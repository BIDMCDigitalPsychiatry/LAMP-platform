1. Log into the app and click on the "Users" tab.
2. Tap the profile icon at top left and select the Manage Credentials option from the drop-down list. 
3. To delete a credential that already exists, tap its icon and select the `Delete` option from the drop-down list.

Please note that this only deletes only the access to data, not the data itself; deleting an object and deleting a credential are different in the LAMP Platform. If no credentials remain, then there is no way to log in from the mindLAMP app.
