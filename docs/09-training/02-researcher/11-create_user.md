1. Log into the app and click on the "Users" tab.
2. Tap the profile icon at top right and select the Manage Credentials option from the drop-down list. 
3. Tap the `[+]` button at the top right of the list; you will be prompted with a counter for the number of patients/participants to add, as you may want to create more than one at a time.
4. Once you create a patient, you will have the opportunity to input an email address and password. This does **not** need to be a real email. You can make the email anything you'd like (e.g. patient@xyz.com).
