3. Another pop-up will show up. Here, you can use the same name or identification for the client (eg. FRV or PT 1673). You do not need to fill out a role for them. Create a made-up email address for them using their initials @lamp.com, and create a password for them that they will remember. Click the grey check mark to save new credentials. NOTE: emails and passwords are case sensitive.

4. Share the client’s mindLAMP email address and password with them so they are able to login on the app and complete the DBT Diary Card.

5. You can change a client’s login credentials at any point by following the same directions – just be sure to share the new credentials with the client so they can login. Clients cannot change their own credentials – only the clinician can change their username and password.
