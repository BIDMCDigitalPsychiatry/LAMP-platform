1. Log into the app and click on the "Users" tab.
2. Tap the profile icon at top left in the blue bar and select the Manage Credentials option from the drop-down list. 
3. Tap the `[+]` icon and enter only: **Name, Email Address, and Password.** You can ignore the **Image** and **Role** field.
4. Click the check mark to save your credential.

Note that the email address you provide **MUST NOT** already be used across any credentials in your instance of the LAMP Platform. If the email address specified is already taken, your credential will fail to be created.

The **Name** field of your very first credential will always be reset to `Default Credential`.

**DO NOT** attempt to reset the password of the credential you are currently using to log into and access mindLAMP. This may prevent you from using the app and lock you out.

1. Log into the app and click on the "Users" tab.
2. Tap the profile icon at top right and select the Manage Credentials option from the drop-down list. 
3. To delete a credential that already exists, tap its icon and select the `Delete` option from the drop-down list.

Please note that this only deletes only the access to data, not the data itself; deleting an object and deleting a credential are different in the LAMP Platform. If no credentials remain, then there is no way to log in from the mindLAMP app.
