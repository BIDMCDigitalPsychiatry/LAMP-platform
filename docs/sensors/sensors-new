All sensor events also contain the timestamp

# Accelerometer
The accelerometer measures acceleration applied to the device. Each measurement is measured in Gs and is taken relative to the coordinate plane of the device, screen facing upwards. For example, a device resting face-up on a flat surface will report a measurement with the coordinate values `<y:0, z:1, x:0>`.

### SensorSpec
`lamp.accelerometer`

### Data
`y`: (type: float, units: G) the Y-axis coordinate
`z`: (type: float, units: G) the Z-axis coordinate
`x`: (type: float, units: G) the X-axis coordinate

### Data Source

# GPS/Location
The location sensor records the device's current GPS coordinates.

### SensorSpec
`lamp.gps`

### Data
`latitude`: (type: float, units: degrees) the coordinate's latitude
`longitude`: (type: float, units: degrees) the coordinate's longitude
`altitude`: (type: float, units: meters) the coordinate's altitude, relative to sea level
`accuracy`: (type: float, units: meters) the coordinate's estimated accuracy representing the radius of a circle formed around the reported latitude/longitude pair, [for which there is AT LEAST a 68% probability that the true coordinate is contained within.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_error_probable)
- `0.0`: no accuracy could be determined
