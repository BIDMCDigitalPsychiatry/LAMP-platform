# mindLAMP

## A Digital Platform for Brain and Behavioral Health

mindLAMP is an **open-source platform** designed to improve how brain and behavioral health is measured, understood, and supported. It brings together research and clinical care in a single, flexible framework. By combining digital data, mobile tools, and collaborative design, mindLAMP enables approaches that are both scientifically rigorous and immediately useful in practice.

## Platform Components

mindLAMP is built around four core components. Together they form a complete platform, but each can also be used independently depending on the needs of a study or clinical program.

## Why It Matters

### The limits of measurement
Traditional approaches to understanding mental health, cognition, and neurology — interviews, questionnaires, and periodic clinical visits — are valuable but limited. They produce snapshots that often miss the daily fluctuations most relevant to outcomes. This gap makes it difficult to align research findings with lived experience, or to guide care based on real-world needs.

### The challenge of access
Even where high-quality care exists, it is out of reach for many. Shortages of providers, costs, long wait times, stigma, and geographic barriers make it difficult to connect with services. Care that does happen is often confined to short, infrequent encounters that leave little opportunity for ongoing monitoring, education, or support.

### The importance of connection
Strong connections between people — whether patients and clinicians or participants and researchers — are critical. Yet between visits or study sessions, those connections are often weak. Clinicians and researchers may lack timely, meaningful data, while patients and participants may feel disengaged, uncertain of whether their contributions matter, or unsupported as their experiences change.

## How mindLAMP Helps

mindLAMP addresses these challenges through the concepts its components enable:

- **Continuous Measurement** → integrates both active and passive data collection to capture daily life in real time.  
- **Expanded Access** → delivers interventions, monitoring, and education directly through mobile devices.  
- **Strengthened Connection** → creates shared environments where data, communication, and feedback flow both ways.

## Continuous Measurement

**Digital Phenotyping** refers to the practice of using data from everyday digital devices to measure behavior, cognition, and context. In mindLAMP, this includes both **passive data** and **active data**:

- **Passive data** are collected in the background from device sensors, reflecting patterns of activity, mobility, and environment.  
- **Active data** come from tasks, surveys, or cognitive activities completed directly by participants, providing insight into subjective experience and performance.  

**Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)** is a form of active data collection where participants answer short surveys about their symptoms, feelings, or experiences in real time. mindLAMP supports EMA through customizable surveys, notifications, and metadata capture (timestamps, response times, engagement metrics).  

By integrating passive and active data, mindLAMP creates a fuller, ecologically valid view of daily life. Passive data provide continuous context; active data capture lived experience; together, they give a more complete understanding.

## Expanding Access

mindLAMP lowers barriers by making care and research tools available on the devices people already use every day.

- For **participants**, the App provides monitoring, self-management, and education — usable wherever they are.  
- For **researchers, clinicians, and coordinators**, the Dashboard offers oversight of study protocols and workflows, with near real-time data to support responsive adjustments.  
- For **multi-site studies**, protocols can be standardized while allowing local adaptations, ensuring consistency at scale without losing flexibility.

---

## Strengthening Connection

The App and Dashboard work together as two sides of the same environment: participants contribute data and engage with tools, while researchers and clinicians interpret, visualize, and act on that information.  

This creates a feedback loop where both sides benefit: participants gain insight into their own patterns, and teams gain the information needed to guide care or adapt study design. Optional messaging and just-in-time interventions strengthen this connection further, ensuring participants remain active contributors rather than passive data sources.

## Proof & Community

mindLAMP is built and sustained through collaboration. Researchers, clinicians, patients, and developers form a community with the shared goal of using digital tools to advance both science and care.

Most teams implement mindLAMP through **LAMP CORE**, the service we provide to support research and clinical programs. CORE requires a business agreement and includes hosting, support, and consultation. This ensures that implementations are reliable, secure, and aligned with scientific and clinical goals.

Because mindLAMP is open source, teams may also adapt the code independently. Projects that take this path should still cite mindLAMP and let us know about their work. Independent implementations, however, are responsible for their own hosting, maintenance, and support.

This balance — open and shareable, yet guided through CORE — has allowed mindLAMP to expand globally while staying rooted in community needs. Patients and participants engage with mindLAMP only through these research and clinical programs, using the App as part of their care or study involvement. This structure ensures that the platform evolves in ways that are scientifically rigorous, clinically relevant, and responsive to the people who use it.
