# Writing Documentation
Documentation formatting needs to be consistent and professional. All documentation is written in markdown. The priority when writing documentation is clarity, and digestibility. Documentation should be no longer than it must be. 

## Process 
1. In order to post documentation, go into BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-Platform/docs on Github. 
2. Each folder within the docs represents a section of the docs website, as shown here. 
![docs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104088715/175102471-01763831-e35e-4821-a5cd-5b531fb9cf5b.JPG)
![order](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104088715/175056626-02ff1818-5ee6-411d-927e-e08fb6e1d951.JPG)
3. Add a file in the appropriate section folder. Give it a name that corresponds to the order where it will appear in the sidebar. 
4. When you are ready to post, go to the bottom of the Github file and select the large green 'Commit new file' button. 'Commit directly to the master branch'. 

The new documentation should then appear in docs.lamp.digital
