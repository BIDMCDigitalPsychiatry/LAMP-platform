### Current MAPNET Specific Features and Information

1. When requested, it can be configured so that patients are unable to view some or all results on the prevent screen. If this is not a current feature for your site and you would like to implement it, please reach out to [team@digitalpsych.org](mailto:team@digitalpsych.org).
2. If viewing LAMP export files in Excel, please ensure to replace the "activity" column with the proper survey name, and add a new "timestamp_txt" column with the formula: `=((A1/1000)-14400)/86400 + 25569` and set the formatting of the column to date-time. (Replace `A1` in the formula with the actual column.)
3. McLean and the other MAPNET sites are now all hosted on the same server. Each MAPNET site functions separately as a researcher on this server. To add more sites, please reach out to [team@digitalpsych.org](mailto:team@digitalpsych.org).

Can data for different responses be in numerical values programmed in (i.e. 0 = not at all) for easier data extraction purposes?
# Conditional Logic

Example: if q9 = true, then enable q11
# Editing Survey Questions

Status: Submitted
Submitted by: Alyssa Williamson

I am trying to correct one of the questions in the process of recovery questionnaire that lists "disagree strongly twice" and keep getting an error message that says it would result in data loss. When I refresh and go into the survey, the change hasn't saved. I tried to log out and log back in, but am still having the same issue. I also tried to add 2 questions to the demographics survey to specify the date of assessment and whether it's followup or baseline (to help me keep track of the backlogged assessments), but I'm getting the same error message.
