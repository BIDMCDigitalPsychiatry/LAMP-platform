# MAPNET

### Current MAPNET Specific Features and Information

1. When requested, it can be configured so that patients are unable to view some or all results on the prevent screen. If this is not a current feature for your site and you would like to implement it, please reach out to [team@digitalpsych.org](mailto:team@digitalpsych.org).
2. If viewing LAMP export files in Excel, please ensure to replace the "activity" column with the proper survey name, and add a new "timestamp_txt" column with the formula: `=((A1/1000)-14400)/86400 + 25569` and set the formatting of the column to date-time. (Replace `A1` in the formula with the actual column.)
3. McLean and the other MAPNET sites are now all hosted on the same server. Each MAPNET site functions separately as a researcher on this server. To add more sites, please reach out to [team@digitalpsych.org](mailto:team@digitalpsych.org).
