# **Self-Deploying User**

Your team can modify and build on the open source code that powers the LAMP Platform to create your own unique new version. Your team will be autonomous from the Division of Digital Psychiatry and will be responsible for supporting the version you build (and submit to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, in case you are customizing the native apps too).

# **Consortium Partner**

Your team can utilize mindLAMP as it is built today with support from us. We will provide two hours of technical training to get you started and include you in monthly webinars. As a partner, you are a member of the LAMP Consortium – a community of LAMP users who share research and ideas.

Consortium partners are required to host their own data if they are not part of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. For more information, please see [Prerequisites for Deploying the LAMP Platform](Prerequisites for Deploying the LAMP Platform.md) and [Deployment Recommendations](Deployment%20Recommendations.md).

If your team is interested in building additional functions and features on LAMP – whether you are a **Self-Deploying User** or **Consortium Partner** – you can provide us with a detailed understanding of the functions and features and we will work with our engineering and design partners to determine the feasibility, cost, and a realistic timeline.
