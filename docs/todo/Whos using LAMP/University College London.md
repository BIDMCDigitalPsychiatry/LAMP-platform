> We are a group of ophthalmologists and psychologists at Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London looking to conduct a study collecting real-world in-situ data on the behaviour and function of patients with inherited eye diseases. These patients suffer with progressive vision loss and require close clinical monitoring to identify changes in disease status, and this absorbs significant resources. We're interested in collecting data that can be transformed into clinically useful biomarkers to inform the need for treatment initiation/augmentation or a referral to psychological support. LAMP contains many of the features we would be interested in using to digitally phenotype these patients.
