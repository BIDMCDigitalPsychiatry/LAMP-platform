# Monash University

Location: Melbourne, Australia
Role: Researchers

> Monash University is developing an Australian-first digital resource to help students and staff identify when they are at risk of mental health problems, and how to seek appropriate help.
The platform - ‘Thrive’ - is being developed by the University’s Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, led by Turner Director and Head of the School of Psychology, Professor Kim Cornish, and is based on a similar platform developed by Harvard University for use with clinical populations.
The digital resource will initially be a portal that can be accessed by all Australian Monash students and staff, where they can find appropriate resources and interventions to improve mental health and well-being.
Eventually, a smartphone app will track a person’s mental health through activity on their phone, including sleep patterns and activity levels, will act as a screener and direct individuals to the most appropriate resource within the portal. It will also be capable of delivering particular interventions on the spot.
After the Australian pilot is completed, the initiative will be rolled out across Monash’s global footprint and to the entire Monash community.
It will be able to provide regular pop-up alerts asking how the person is going, and provide general information on Monash resources that can provide assistance, including counselling services, exercise programs at Monash Sport, peer support and other programs.
