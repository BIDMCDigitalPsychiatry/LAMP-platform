# BIDMC Anesthesiology and Surgery

Location: Boston, Massachusetts, United States
Role: Researchers

> The goal of the study is to help to understand the different anesthetic options available prior to surgery, increase patient engagement and encourage shared decision making with their surgical team... Our MAC Decision Aid research is being conducted using a smartphone app LAMP platform, created by a multidisciplinary team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for research without commercial involvement. Subjects who consented for the study are taught how to download and use the app. They are asked to complete pre-survey, read about monitored anesthesia care and then complete post-survey. Preliminary data (10 patients of 100) demonstrates that an electronic based educational and assessment system is feasible.
