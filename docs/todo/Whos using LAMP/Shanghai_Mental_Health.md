# Shanghai Mental Health

Location: Shanghai, China
Role: Researchers

> Shanghai Mental Health leveraged LAMPâ€™s open-source platform to create BrainSmart. BrainSmart is an app with similar capabilities as LAMP, including customizable games and surveys that can be used to engage patients. Shanghai Mental Health used BrainSmart in a study that investigated whether interactive technology is feasible way to enhance cognitive function of patients at clinical risk for psychosis. The prevalence of smartphones, paired with high reports of regular app use, suggest that engaging technology may be an avenue for building on cognitive capabilities.
