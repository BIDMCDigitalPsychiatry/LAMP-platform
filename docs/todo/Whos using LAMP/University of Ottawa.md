> Our study investigates the validity of mindLAMP, a smartphone application for both Apple and Android phones, in assessing cognition in individuals with a mental illness. While preliminary, our findings suggest that mindLAMP can be used to assess cognitive impairments in individuals with a mental illness. As a novel tool, mindLAMP has the potential to enable dynamic, scalable, and longitudinal assessment of cognition in research and clinical setting.
