> The objective of our research using the mindLAMP app is to understand how oneâ€™s internal and contextual experience shapes cognitive function from moment to moment. Our current work involves smartphone assessment of cognition and context in young adults as well as individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Our hope is through digital phenotyping we can determine how patterns of fluctuation can help improve clinical diagnosis and point us towards personalized and precision interventions.

- **Abstract:** Assessing the convergence between smartphone- and lab-based neuropsychological assessment

    **Objective:** Current methods of neuropsychological assessment are time-intensive and costly, which limits access. Further, they do not capture intraindividual variation in cognition across time (day-to-day, hour-to-hour) and context (e.g., mood, environment).Â Repeated assessment using smartphones represents a potential solution to these limitations, but validation is needed across populations and cognitive domains. In this study we assess the convergent validity of smartphone-based tests by examining relations with standard neuropsychological assessments and self-reported executive dysfunction in young adults (YAs) and individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD).

    **Participants and Methods:** 179 YAs (undergraduate students) and 20 persons with PD completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, including the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A). Over the following 10 days they were prompted 5x/day to complete smartphone-based assessments of working memory (Backwards Spatial Span) and complex attention (Trails-B). PD participants completed lab-based equivalents of these tests, WMS-III Spatial Span and Trails A & B, along with the MoCA, at baseline. We examined associations between lab- and smartphone-based measures using multilevel modeling to account for clustering of observations within people. Lab-based measures were entered as fixed effect predictors of variance in smartphone-based assessments.

    **Results:** BRIEF ratings in both YA and PD samples did not predict smartphone-based assessments nor lab-based measures in PD. In the PD sample, Trails-B at baseline predicted significant variance in smartphone-based Trails-B scores (*p*=0.03); Backwards Spatial Span score at baseline showed a trend association with Backwards Spatial Span as measured by smartphone (*p*=0.11). MoCA score at baseline also showed a trend association with smartphone-based Trails-B (*p*=0.05) and Backwards Spatial Span (*p*=0.08) scores.

    **Conclusions** We provide preliminary evidence of convergent validity between smartphone-based assessments of complex attention and working memory and traditional neuropsychological tests in people with PD. Self-report of executive dysfunction did not relate to objective lab- or smartphone-based measures. These findings pave the way for a new era of more personalized assessment of cognition in real-world settings, with potential for more precise diagnosis and treatment.

- **Abstract:** Mobile cognitive assessment via smartphones: Studying how context shapes cognition in young adults and persons with Parkinsonâ€™s disease

    **Authors** Emma Weizenbaum, Alice Cronin-Golomb, Emma L. Pinsky, John Torous, Daniel Fulford

    **Objective:** Cognition fluctuates depending on state and context. Capturing diagnostically sensitive intraindividual variability in cognition in lab or clinic settings is typically infeasible and lacking inÂ ecological validity. To improve precision of diagnosis and identify areas for personalized intervention, we can capitalize on the ubiquity of smartphones to measure real-world contexts that shape such cognitive variability. In this study we sought to assess the feasibility and validity of an open-access neuropsychological assessment app in young adults (YA) and individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD).

    **Participants and Methods:** 179 YAs (undergraduate students) and 20 persons with PD filled out questionnaires at baseline and then were prompted to complete smartphone assessments of social context, mood, alertness, and motivation 5x/day for 10 days as they went about daily life. Those with PD also reported on their medication state. Participants were prompted to complete mobile tests of working memory (Backwards Spatial Span) and complex attention (Trails-B), also 5x/day for 10 days. In addition, people with PD completed the MoCA, Spatial Span, Trails A & B, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in the lab at baseline.

    **Results:** Response rate to smartphone assessments was 58% in YA and 73% in PD. Response rate declined by 34% in YA over 10 days, but increased by 48% in persons with PD. In YA, lower response rate was related to higher baseline negative emotion. In PD, there were no significant correlates of response rate. Participants with PD cited survey schedule and technical difficulties as deterrents of response. In YA, accuracy on games improved by 4.5% on Trails B (*t* = 5.66, *p* < 0.01) and 5.3% on Backwards Spatial Span (*t* = 2.89, *p* <0.01). In PD, accuracy on games improved by 3.8% on Trails-B (*t* = 0.58, *p* = 0.57) and 15.7% on Backwards Spatial Span (*t* = 2.20, *p* = 0.04).

    **Conclusions:** Repeated smartphone assessment of cognition and context in both YA and persons with PD is a feasible approach. We will also present findings regarding the impact of contextual factors, such as time of day, social context, mood, alertness, and motivation, on variability in cognitive performance.
