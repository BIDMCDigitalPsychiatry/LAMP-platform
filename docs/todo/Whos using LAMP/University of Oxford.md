> In this study we aim to use digital interventions to improve mental wellbeing in the general population, with a specific target of four groups that are particularly, but very differently, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: people in isolation, students, athletes, and frontline clinical staff. Clinical staff will likely have limited flexibility in their daily routine, but those who can no longer work will have too much flexibility. We will capture digital phenotypes of participants as well as signals related to interventions like mood, anxiety, diet, sleep, steps etc (as noted above). We will compare a standard intervention (using the app to deliver generic advice and instructions about pre-defined interventions) with a personalised one (using information based on individual differences and preferences in a personalised and dynamic way). All data will be de-identified and made freely available to the scientific community at the end of the study.
