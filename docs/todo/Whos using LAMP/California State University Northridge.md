Role: Researchers

> In our Social Psychology in Everyday Life Lab at CSU Northridge, we used mindLAMP to augment our data collection for longitudinal studies of smartphone-related cognition and behavior. We programmed mindLAMP to deliver regular ecological momentary assessment measures, including brief surveys capturing the intentionality/automaticity of the user's prior smartphone usage and their current mood, life satisfaction, and context. We also attempted to capture some basic cognitive constructs using mindLAMPâ€™s built-in attention and memory assessment games, like the n-back test. Our intention is to assess whether higher levels of automaticity (mindless, impulsive use) during the prior phone usage predict lower levels of present-moment mood. Weâ€™d also like to assess the influence of context, such the userâ€™s location, the presence of others, and the duration and content of their smartphone uses on automaticity and well-being. Ultimately, we hope this research helps us better understand the relationship between smartphone users and their devices and assess whether well-being can be enhanced by implementing interventions for more intentional use.
