### Hosting Your Data

LAMP users are currently required to host their own data. The Division of Digital Psychiatry is no longer able to host data from sites outside of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The exception to this policy is for external studies that the Division of Digital Psychiatry is a part of. Please see [Prerequisites for Deploying the LAMP Platform](Prerequisites%20for%20Deploying%20the%20LAMP%20Platform.md) for more information about hosting your data.
