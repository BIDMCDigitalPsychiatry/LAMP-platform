# What are the Components of LAMP?

# LAMP is Organized Into Four Tabs: 
Learn, Assess, Manage Prevent

# **LEARN**

Tips and resources for patients and study participants are entered by researchers or clinicians through the Dashboard. Notifications for patients and study participants to review tips or resources can be preset and customized to be delivered at any time during the day.

Clinicians and researchers offer patients and study participants useful health related tips and resources in the Learn tab.

To learn more about customizing a tip for a patient, check out [Customize and Schedule Activities](Activities%20Tips,%20Surveys,%20and%20Cognitive%20Tests/Customize%20and%20Schedule%20Activities.md).

# **ASSESS**

Surveys and cognitive games – their content, answer choice style, and time of delivery – are customized by clinicians and researchers in the Dashboard. Patients and study participants complete them on the app and answers are stored over time.

Patients and study participants complete cognitive games and customized surveys related to mood, symptoms, and behaviors unique to them through the Assess tab.

To learn how to create surveys for this tab, check out [Create Surveys](Activities%20Tips,%20Surveys,%20and%20Cognitive%20Tests/Create%20Surveys.md).

mindLAMP collects a combination of active and passive data. Patients and study participants, and clinicians and researchers, can view aggregated data on mindLAMP or on the Dashboard. Data appears in charts.

Data collected from mindLAMP – including survey responses and passive data such as step count – can be viewed through the Prevent tab.

To learn more about viewing your data, see [Visualize data](Visualize%20data.md).
