Can data for different responses be in numerical values programmed in (i.e. 0 = not at all) for easier data extraction purposes?

I am trying to correct one of the questions in the process of recovery questionnaire that lists "disagree strongly twice" and keep getting an error message that says it would result in data loss. When I refresh and go into the survey, the change hasn't saved. I tried to log out and log back in, but am still having the same issue. I also tried to add 2 questions to the demographics survey to specify the date of assessment and whether it's followup or baseline (to help me keep track of the backlogged assessments), but I'm getting the same error message.
