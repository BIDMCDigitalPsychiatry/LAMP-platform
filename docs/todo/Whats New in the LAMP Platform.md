`**IMPROVEMENTS**`

### **Improved Native Apps**

- Updated and refactored the iOS and Android apps for higher performance and support for new enhanced features.
    - mindLAMP now requires a minimum version of iOS 14 or watchOS 6.
    - This update will be rolling out in the coming weeks once approved by Apple and Google.
- Updated push notifications to collect metadata about notifications and user interactions as a new sensor type.

### **Improved Native Apps**

- Updated graphing code to be higher performance and restored Step Count graphs.
- Updated error boundaries to display errors to the user instead of crashing to an unhelpful blank screen, and added a version number.

### Hardened Security Requirements

- Hardened security requirements for enterprise deployments will be rolling out in the coming weeks.
    - Clinicians will need to request their system administrator to be added to a clinic/study and system administrators may generate a password of sufficient complexity as required by organizational policies.
    - Patients and study participants will need to request their clinician or research coordinators to reset their password or add additional care team members.

---

`**BUG FIXES**`

- Resolved minor labeling and functionality issues with the DBT Diary Card activity.
- Resolved an issue where the backend message queue would not accept large payloads and inadvertently crash the API Server.
- Resolved an issue where Breathe exercises did not record duration spent correctly.
- Resolved issues in rare cases with embedded activities (i.e. Jewels) not receiving the correct language code for translations support at runtime.
- Resolved an issue where Activity Groups appeared in the Prevent tab incorrectly.
- Resolved an issue where tapping a notification could lead to a blank page instead of an embedded activity.
- Resolved an issue where loading patients' data could erroneously take twice as long as expected.
- We are aware of an issue with scrolling being temporarily locked on Safari browsers when viewing the Patient or Activity tabs in the dashboard; a temporary workaround is to resize the browser window, after which scrolling will resume normally.
- We are aware of an issue leading to slower than expected performance and speed when using the Patient tab of the dashboard across all browsers; a resolution for this issue is in progress.

# October 5th, 2020 ‚Äî 
General Availability of mindLAMP 2

---

`**FEATURES**` 

![What's New in the LAMP Platform/banner.png](What's New in the LAMP Platform/banner.png)

![What's New in the LAMP Platform/app-image.png](What's New in the LAMP Platform/app-image.png)

### Brand new user experience

- The new **Feed** tab will assist patients/participants with a heads-up of what needs to be completed each day, as well as what's already been completed in the past.
- The bright new user interface is approachable, friendly, and easy to use! You'll find the **Learn**, **Assess**, **Manage**, and **Prevent** tabs familiar, but now simplified and better organized.
- Management of studies and clinics is now simplified with a visual makeover that you can use in the browser dashboard or on-the-go when logged in as a clinician in the mobile app.

### New activities and interventions

- We've ported over some classics such as **Surveys** or the beloved **Jewels** game from mindLAMP 1, so you won't miss those.
- We've also added brand new activities such as **Tips** for customizable articles, **Breathe** for meditation and breathing exercises, **Journal** for a digital journal and thoughts tracker, and several more!
- **Conversations** now allow you to communicate with study participants or patients in the clinic. *(This is a completely optional feature that is disabled by default. Please see the user guide for more details.)*

### Visual data dashboard

- The new app experience also allows customizing how you want to see and work with data, located in the **Prevent** tab of the app.
- We have more planned for data visualization ‚Äî stay tuned! ‚ú®

### Wearables support

- mindLAMP 2 introduces support for the Apple Watch and Google wearOS watches (Fossil, Skagen, TicWatch, and others), and you can download these apps independently of the mobile apps.
- Because the screen sizes are typically too small for complex interaction, the wearable apps are limited to only passive sensor collection.

Please note that we're currently investigating an issue that significantly impacts the sensor collection frequency of device motion on iOS and Apple Watch devices.

---

`**IMPROVEMENTS**`

### Push notifications

- While mindLAMP 1 supported local notifications to remind patients/participants to take surveys or play cognitive games, it was not always reliable.
- We've upgraded our infrastructure to support directly sending notifications to devices from the cloud, ensuring that everyone receives activities on schedule.
- You'll also be able to track when a notification was received by a device and the time interval between when it was received and when the activity (such as a daily survey) was opened.

### Database improvements

- Data scientists and researchers will now be able to use our powerful API across the [R](https://github.com/BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-r), [Python](https://github.com/BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-python), [Javascript](https://github.com/BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-js), [Swift](https://github.com/BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-swift), and [Kotlin](https://github.com/BIDMCDigitalPsychiatry/LAMP-kotlin) programming languages.
- Security and performance improvements make it simpler to share data with others using Credentials and download data quickly using our Event-based API.
- It's now possible for organizations to deploy the LAMP Platform on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or on-premise quickly and effectively. For more information, check out [Deploy & Develop LAMP](https://www.notion.so/Deploy-Develop-LAMP-7e06a70a07ee43bd9b70862367a2f2b9).
