# Gyroscope

SensorSpec: lamp.gyroscope

### Description

The gyroscope sensors measures the rate of rotation around each of a device's x, y and z axes. Rotation values are in radians/second. Positive values indicate counter-clockwise rotation; negative values indicate clockwise rotation. These are raw valuesâ€”i.e. they do not correct for nosie or drift.

### Settings

### Data

- `x: number` (units: rad/s) the rotational velocity around the x-axis. The x-axis goes from left to right, across the device's screen face
- `y: number` (units: rad/s) the rotational velocity around the y-axis. The y-axis is vertical and points up
- `z: number` (units: rad/s) the rotational velocity around the z-axis. The z-axis is horizontal and points out from the front screen (towards the user looking at the screen)
