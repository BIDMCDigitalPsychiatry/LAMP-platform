# Motion

SensorSpec: lamp.accelerometer.motion

### Description

The motion sensor gathers information on the device's physical movement. It includes metrics on device tilt, rotation, experienced gravity, acceleration, and magnetic field. The acceleration measure here differs from `lamp.accelerometer` in that this measure does not correct for gravity.

### Data

- `tilt: object`
    - 
- `rotation: object`
    - `x: number`: the rotation vector component around the x-axis, which points tangentially along the ground, to the East: `x * sin(theta/2)`
    - `y: number`: the rotation vector component around the y-axis, which points tangent along the ground, to the North: `y * sin(theta/2)`
    - `z: number`: the rotation vector component around the z-axis, which points towards the sky, perpendicular to the ground: `z * sin(theta/2)`

- `gravity: object`
    - `x: number`: the force of gravity along the device's x-axis, where the x-axis runs from left to right, across the front screen
    - `y: number`: the force of gravity along the device's y-axis, where the y-axis runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the device's screen
    - `z: number`: the force of gravity along the device's z-axis, where the z-axis runs towards the outside of the device's screen (toward the user)
- `user_accel: object`:
    - `x: number`: the device's acceleration along its x-axis, where the x-axis runs from left to right, across the front screen
    - `y: number`: the device's acceleration along its y-axis, where the y-axis runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the device's screen
    - `z: number`: the device's acceleration along its z-axis, where the z-axis runs towards the outside of the device's screen (toward the user)
- `magnetic_field: object`:
    - `x: number` : (units: micro T) the geomagnetic field strength along the device's x-axis, where the x-axis runs from left to right, across the front screen
    - `y: number`: (units: micro T) the geomagnetic field strength along the device's y-axis, where the y-axis runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the device's screen
    - `z: number`: (units: micro T) the geomagnetic field strength along the device's z-axis, where the z-axis runs towards the outside of the device's screen (toward the user)
    - `calibration_accuracy: number` : the sensor's accuracy level. One of:
        - `-1`: invalid; the sensor is reporting data but is not connected to its environment.
        - `0`: none; the sensor is reporting data that is not calibrated and cannot be trusted.
        - `1`: low; the sensor is reporting data at poor accuracy, and environmental calibration is required.
        - `2`: medium; the sensor is reporting data at an average accuracy, and environmental calibration of the device may improve data.
        - `3`: high; the sensor is reporting data at maximal accuracy and is correctly calibrated.
