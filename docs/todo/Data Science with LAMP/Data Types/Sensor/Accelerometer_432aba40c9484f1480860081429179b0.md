# Accelerometer

SensorSpec: lamp.accelerometer

### Description

The triaxial accelerometer measures acceleration applied to the device. Each measurement is measured in Gs and is taken relative to the coordinate plane of the device, screen facing upwards. For example, a device resting face-up on a flat surface will report a measurement with the coordinate values `<0, 0, 1>`.

### Settings

- `frequency: number`: (units: Hz) the required accelerometer measurement frequency; the sensor will make a best effort to match the requested `frequency` but no guarantees are made by the device hardware or operating system.

### Data

- `x: number`: (units: G) the X-axis coordinate.
- `y: number`: (units: G) the Y-axis coordinate.
- `z: number`: (units: G) the Z-axis coordinate.
- `accuracy: number`:  (units: None) the data accuracy level, or `null` if unavailable.
    - `-1`: invalid; the sensor is reporting data but is not connected to its environment.
    - `0`: none; the sensor is reporting data that is not calibrated and cannot be trusted.
    - `1`: low; the sensor is reporting data at poor accuracy, and environmental calibration is required.
    - `2`: medium; the sensor is reporting data at an average accuracy, and environmental calibration of the device may improve data.
    - `3`: high; the sensor is reporting data at maximal accuracy and is correctly calibrated.
