HEALTHCARE DISCLAIMER

In the United States, or any other jurisdictions where they may apply, the 
following additional disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability are 
hereby incorporated into the terms and conditions of BSD 3-Clause License:

No warranties of any kind whatsoever are made as to the results that You will 
obtain from relying upon the covered code (or any information or content 
obtained by way of the covered code), including but not limited to compliance 
with privacy laws or regulations or clinical care industry standards and protocols. 
Use of the covered code is not a substitute for a health care providerâ€™s 
standard practice or professional judgment. Any decision with regard to the 
appropriateness of treatment, or the validity or reliability of information 
or content made available by the covered code, is the sole responsibility of 
the health care provider. Consequently, it is incumbent upon each health care 
provider to verify all medical history and treatment plans with each patient.

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including 
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who 
distributes Covered Software as permitted by the license, be liable to You 
for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential damages of any character 
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other damages or losses, of 
any nature whatsoever (direct or otherwise) on account of or associated with 
the use or inability to use the covered content (including, without limitation, 
the use of information or content made available by the covered code, all 
documentation associated therewith, and the failure of the covered code to 
comply with privacy laws and regulations or clinical care industry standards 
and protocols), even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility 
of such damages.
